As we’ve said in the class efficiency is a pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay, give an explanation of what that term “efficiency” means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance. Your essay should address the following questions:

-   What is the definition of “efficiency”?

-   What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science?

-   What does efficiency allow you to do?

-   Why is efficiency important?

-   Where did you encounter efficiency, and what were some [“a-ha” moments](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aha%20moment) you had about efficiency? (For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the portfolio.)

My understanding of efficiency in statistical computing has evolved from focusing solely on speed and effort to emphasizing adaptability and reproducibility. While it’s possible to quickly get answers in R, poorly formatted outputs and repetitive steps make the process harder to understand and modify. The definition of efficiency is creating solutions that are streamlined, easy to adapt, reduce redundancy, and are time efficient.

Efficiency in statistical computing and data science is streamlining code to minimize time spent coding while maximizing the clarity and accuracy of results. One way that this can look is avoiding repeated code. Rather than repeating the same code across multiple variables or datasets, there are functions such as across(), including multiple statements within one function. These types of tools that allow us to avoid more manual work, and allow R to apply functions across multiple objects. Efficiency allows for scalability and predictability. As projects grow in scope, efficient practices make sure that results remain trustworthy even when datasets increase in size or complexity. One of our learning targets, R-3, mentions being able to write robust programs that are resistant to changes in inputs. This is a key part of efficiency in statistical computing, because rather than continuously editing your code based on how large your dataset is, or what specific tables you’re dealing with, you can focus on the insights and adding code to further explore.

Efficiency is important because it impacts the quality and timeliness of insights. In a time where data is growing exponentially, inefficient practices can quickly become unmanageable, wasting time and resources. The ability to process and analyze data efficiently can provide a competitive edge to someone, especially for businesses that rely on data analysis for decision-making. By understanding how to deal with data in an efficient way, we will be prepared to deal with even larger and messier datasets.

I have encountered personal growth in efficiency throughout this course. The first is related to using new tools to iterate and reduce repetition in my code. In my final portfolio, Lab 3 Quetion 5 in section PE-3 shows that utilizing the across() function allowed me to make changes across several variables in my dataset, rather than having several lines of repeated code. This was an a-ha moment for me because I learned a new tool that would save me a lot of time. A second way that I became more efficient was by learning how to build my own functions. This is demonstrated in section PE-2, specifically in Challenge 7 Question 3. Functions make it much easier to mutate variables in larger data sets. An a-ha moment for me was implementing stops in my functions that indicate errors in inputs. This is efficient in order to prevent errors from propagating through the code, ensuring that my functions produce reliable results and saving time on debugging later.

Learning about efficiency in statistical computing has made me more intentional in my coding. Even though it has been a learning curve that has taken time, it will take less time for me to code moving forward because I’ll be dealing less with redundant code, and more time finding insights!
