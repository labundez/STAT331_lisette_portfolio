***Describe how you have improved as a practitioner and student of data science this quarter through your work in the course.***

-   Focus specifically on data science concepts and the skills we employed in learning them, not a laundry list of topics that you learned (those are in the syllabus, so I know them already).

-   Focus on a small number of specific areas of growth for you that happened in STAT 331. Identify at least one artifact in your portfolio that illustrates each area of growth and explain how this artifact shows growth in the way you are describing.

Throughout my time in STAT 331, I have seen improvement in my data visualization and data cleaning skills.

With data visualization specifically, I grew in my knowledge of ggplot2 by learning about global and local aesthetics, the purposes of different graphs, and editing small details on the graph. DVS-2 best displays my growth in data visualization because through this course, I learned how to keep the reader in mind when creating visualizations. In Challenge 2 (used in the DVS-2 portion of my portfolio), I had to be cognizant of the readers who may tilt their head to read the axis and make changes to my graph in order to make it clearer. Additionally, in Lab 4 Question 6 (used in the DVS-2 portion of my portfolio), I practiced changing the size of axis text to be easier to read and reordering legends to be more easily interpreted. I learned that it’s important for a reader who has no knowledge of the dataset, to be able to look at my graph and pull a result from it.

My data wrangling skills have significantly grown since being in this class, and most of it is related to the fact that I’ve learned so many new tools, specifically dyplr! Learning how to filter, mutate, and join tables in R has been a game changer, as well as knowing how to do so efficiently in one pipeline. Through this class, I have grown in confidence to be able to manipulate raw data to pull relevant information. In my final portfolio, WD-5 is an example of my growth in this area, particularly In Lab 5, where I am finding the initial suspect of the murder. Previous to this class, my thought process would be to hard code between tables, tracking the consistent person id’s until I found the suspect using the appropriate filters. I’m proud of my work in this lab, because I demonstrate my new knowledge of combining all these steps into one clean, tidy pipeline where I join tables to gather the data I need, rather than tracking id’s across different tables. Then, I'm able to filter in that same pipeline. This was a key lesson for me, because these data wrangling concepts apply across many different platforms and datasets.

As someone who is interested in the data analysis fields, becoming more proficient in these areas has given me the tools neededto run an analysis from start to finish, from raw data to data visualization!
