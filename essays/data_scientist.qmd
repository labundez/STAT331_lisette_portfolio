***Describe how you have improved as a practitioner and student of data science this quarter through your work in the course.***

-   Focus specifically on data science concepts and the skills we employed in learning them, not a laundry list of topics that you learned (those are in the syllabus, so I know them already).

-   Focus on a small number of specific areas of growth for you that happened in STAT 331. Identify at least one artifact in your portfolio that illustrates each area of growth and explain how this artifact shows growth in the way you are describing.

Throughout my time in STAT 331, I have seen improvement in my data visualization and data cleaning skills. Entering this class as a Quantitative Analysis concentration Business student, I had previous experience in both of these areas, but I grew in ways that I did not know I needed! I enjoy using data to solve ambiguous problems and have a larger impact. But, based on my feedback that I have received in this course so far, I’ve realized that at times, this has led me to not being fully intentional with the formatting and execution of my visualizations, or forgetting little details in cleaning data. These changes have made all the difference in how I approach data science concepts. 

With data visualization specifically, I grew in my knowledge of ggplot2. I have taken R classes previously, but always struggled with making my graphs look how I want, or even fully understanding how to plot different types of graphs. Using ggplot, I now understand how you can add different layers, add geoms, and add aesthetics to certain layers according to what you want your graph to look like. More specifically, DVS-2 best displays my growth in data visualization because through this course, I learned how to keep the reader in mind when creating visualizations. In Challenge 2 (used in the DVS-2 portion of my portfolio), I had to be cognizant of the readers who may tilt their head to read the axis and make changes to my graph in order to make it clearer. Additionally, in Lab 4 Question 6 (used in the DVS-2 portion of my portfolio), I practiced changing axis text to be easier to read and reordering legends to be more easily interpreted. These were key aspects to my growth because while I knew these small changes can have a large impact, I did not know how to execute them until this course. As I mentioned earlier, I enjoy making graphs and pulling results from it. But I learned that it’s just as important for a reader who has no knowledge of the dataset, to be able to look at my graph and also see my findings. Without readable labels, clear legends, aesthetic axes, this purpose is not fulfilled. I’m glad to be improving in this area and hope to continue improving!

My data wrangling skills have significantly grown since being in this class, and most of it is related to the fact that I’ve learned so many new tools, specifically dyplr! Before this class, I was mainly given clean, straightfoward datasets and had to run analysis. Learning how to filter, mutate, and join tables in R has been a game changer, as well as knowing how to do so efficiently in one pipeline. Through this class, I have grown in confidence to be able to run analysis from the beginning, where the data is raw and requires sufficient manipulation in order to draw insights from it. In my final portfolio, WD-5 is an example of my growth in this area, particularly In Lab 5, where I am finding the initial suspect of the murder. Previous to this class, my thought process would be to hard code between tables, tracking the consistent person id’s until I found the suspect using the appropriate filters. I’m proud of my work in this lab, because I demonstrate my new knowledge of combining all these steps into one clean, tidy pipeline where I join tables to gather the data I need, rather than tracking id’s across different tables. Then, I filtered in that same pipeline! For data scientists, it's important to be able to wrangle and manipulate data to get a dataset that is most relevant to answering your question. I have grown in this area during this course and have a new understanding of data that can be applied across several business scenarios.

I’m proud to be growing in these areas, as they are relevant to data analyst roles that I hope to enter in the future. Having this foundation in R easily translates across several other tools and programs, and I will continue this class being sure to be intentional and concise in my data visualizations, and efficient in my data wrangling.
